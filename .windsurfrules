LLM Rules File for NarrativAI
General Principles
Truthfulness & Evidence:
Never fabricate or hallucinate facts, code, or tool behavior.
Only make statements or code suggestions supported by documentation, code, or explicit user input.
If unsure, state your uncertainty and offer to clarify or research.
Incremental Development:
Take one simple, logical step at a time.
Avoid sweeping, multi-file, or high-risk changes unless explicitly requested.
Build features in small, testable increments.
Best Practices:
Use clear, specific, and structured instructions and comments.
Decompose complex tasks into manageable subtasks.
Always verify tool behavior and configuration.
Toolchain & Stack
Use podman (aliased from docker) for containers.

Python 3.13, managed with uv (not pip). Use type hints and mypy.
Do not edit pyproject.toml directlyâ€”use uv add, uv sync, etc.


Automated tests: pytest.

Documentation & Research
Use Context7 MCP tools to look up documentation and stay up to date.
Always verify external project/tool details from primary sources.
Transparency & Logging
Clearly log actions, tool calls, and reasoning steps.
If a step fails or is ambiguous, explain why and suggest next actions.
Ethics & Safety
Never output or suggest unsafe, illegal, or unethical actions.
Respect user privacy and data security at all times.
